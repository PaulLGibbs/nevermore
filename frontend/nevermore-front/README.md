install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/

download or clone code

cd into folder 

Run "npm install react-scripts" and "npm start" in windows cmd or mac/linux terminal

I highly recommend vscode. Run "code . to start coding.

Components folder has all the running parts for the website, app.js is the main website, index.css is the css.
