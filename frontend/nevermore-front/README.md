* install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/ and npm (node.js comes with npm already if on windows)
* install git https://git-scm.com/

* download or clone code thru "git clone -b emanuel --single-branch https://github.com/PaulLGibbs/nevermore.git"

* cd into folder nevermore/frontend/nevermore-front

* add api key nevermore/frontend/nevermore-front/components/twLogin. Line 9. (i cant put this on github)

* Run "npm install"  in terminal

* Run "npm start" in windows cmd or mac/linux terminal, then default browser will popup with the webpage on localhost.

* Open up folder in code editor. I highly recommend vscode run "code ." to start coding in vscode.

* This is written in react.js. Components folder has all the running parts for the website, app.js is the main website, index.css is the css. 

* Commit, push if you make any changes.
