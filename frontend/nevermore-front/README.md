install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/ and npm (node.js comes with npm already if on windows)
install git https://git-scm.com/

download or clone code thru "git clone -b emanuel --single-branch https://github.com/PaulLGibbs/nevermore.git"

cd into folder 

Run "npm install react-scripts" and "npm start" in windows cmd or mac/linux terminal, then default browser will popup with the webpage on localhost.

Open up folder in code editor. I highly recommend vscode run "code ." to start coding in vscode.

Components folder has all the running parts for the website, app.js is the main website, index.css is the css.

Commit, push if you make any changes.
